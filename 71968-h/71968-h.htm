  <h2 class='c009'>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>This</span> little book is the outcome of talks with Mrs. Bishop
over some of the photographs which were taken by her in
one or other of her journeys into and across China. Some
of the photographs have already appeared in her published
works, “The Yangtze Valley and Beyond” and “Korea
and Her Neighbourhood” (2 vols., Murray). The notes
were, in substance, dictated by Mrs. Bishop. It is hoped
they contain some real information on the people, their
surroundings, and habits which, though slight in form, may
be helpful to a better understanding of a very difficult
problem.</p>
<p class='c011'>According to our newspaper press to-day, the Chinese
are simply cruel barbarians. According to Mrs. Bishop,
when you know them they are a likeable people—and she
has formed this opinion in spite of the fact that, in their
deeply-rooted hatred of the foreigners, they twice attacked
her with violence. A real understanding of the people is
for us, with our different modes of thought, most difficult
to arrive at; but we shall not advance towards it by
accepting all the evil reports and shutting our ears to the
good ones. That the problem of China is, and will for
some time continue to be, the most interesting question to
the rest of the world is certain. The future of its people
is all unknown, but there are in it possibilities which make
it a terror to all other nations.</p>

</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Out</span> in the country there are practically no roads, as we
understand roads. It is necessary to cultivate every inch
of available ground, and the farmer begrudges anything
taken from the fields for the paths, which are but a foot
or two wide. It is easy to understand that, under such
conditions, the almost universal mode of passenger transit
is by chairs and bearers. The narrowness of the paths is
a source of trouble. When two parties of bearers approach
each other, there is much shouting to induce one or other
to return and make way; but when both come on, one
has to get off, or be pushed off, into the swamp by the
sides. When one is a foreigner his portion is invariably the
swamp.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bearers are patient, much-enduring people, who do
their work thoroughly and without complaining, in the face
of mud, and rain, and difficult roads. They will carry a
traveller from twenty to twenty-five miles a day. When
a lady occupies the chair the curtains are rigidly closed.
It would be at the risk of her life to travel in an open
chair. There is much etiquette connected with the getting
in and out of chairs, which wise travellers never neglect.
The photograph is of a lady’s chair.</p>

of shoulder is necessary, and the stopping
to make this change becomes a
serious matter in a journey of any

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>This</span> Chengtu Plain, with its 2,500
square miles of country and 4,000,000
population, is perhaps the best cultivated
and most fertile spot in the world.
It owes its fertility to the work of two
engineers, who, more than two thousand
years ago (250 years <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>), designed and
carried out the most perfect system of
irrigation. They were Li Ping, the
father, and his son, and are familiarly
known to-day as the first and second
gentlemen of China. The land bears
four crops in the year. With all this
produce and population, the traffic is
enormous, and it is mainly carried on
by means of wheelbarrows, which are
so contrived, by placing the wheel in
the centre and platforms at the side
and behind it, as to enable one man
to wheel five hundredweight with ease.
The narrow roads of the plain are
covered by an almost endless procession
of these wheelbarrows, which are
often preceded by one man pulling in
addition to the man behind.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>If</span> China cannot boast of its roads, it may claim to be a
country of waterways, rivers and canals forming the chief
means of communication. The country being so large,
travellers have to spend much time in going from place to
place, and living accommodation has to be provided on the
boats. It is very rough. The illustration gives a good
specimen of a small boat which may be hired for a journey.
The mat roof is placed over the open part at night. In the
daytime this space is occupied by the rowers. In the night
they roll themselves up in their wadded quilts and sleep
there. In China there is no privacy, but much curiosity.
No part of your boat, although you have hired it, is sacred
to you; the boatmen pass in and out of what you
may regard as your cabin without consideration for you.
Mrs. Bishop put up curtains around her cabin to shut out
prying eyes, and as far as they could the people respected
her evident desire to be alone.</p>

manned and maintained at the cost of Benevolent
Guilds—one of the many charitable guilds in the country—for
the purpose of assisting the crews of boats which get into

and the Red Lifeboat has saved the lives of many foreigners

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>China</span> is the country of guilds. All workmen and traders
have their guilds. To this rule there are but two exceptions—the
water-carriers and the trackers (men who drag
the boats up the rapids); these alone have no trade organisation.
These guilds, or trade unions, are as complete and
as effective for good or harm as anything we know in this
country. They watch most jealously the interests of their
craft. But the guild enters into the life of the people at
every turn. The charities of the Empire, which are
numerous, are conducted by guilds. There is, perhaps, little
personal charity and benevolence; it is safer to leave these
to the guilds. But there is scarcely a town of any size
that has not its Guild of Benevolence. Soup kitchens, clothing
for the living, coffins and burial for the dead, hospitals,
free dispensaries, orphan and foundling homes, life-boats,
and many other charities are the outcome of these Guilds
of Benevolence.</p>

to death he is of no more use, and why
should time and care be wasted on him?
This coolie in the picture was one of
Mrs. Bishop’s carriers, who fell sick by
the way, and though he had been a
companion of the other men for many

years, waiting for the professional decision
as to a favourable day. In such

uncommon thing for Mrs. Bishop, on
her journey in Sze Chuan, to have to
sleep in a room where a coffin was
stored, waiting the day of its interment,
incense burning and other religious
rites being daily performed in front of
it. To prevent mischief owing to the
retention of bodies above ground for
so long a time, the coffins are built of
very thick wood, the bodies are placed
in lime, the joints of the coffin are
cemented, and the whole covered with

feature of the country is its
city gates. There is a great family
likeness between them, the usual fort-like
building surmounting the wall
where it is pierced by the gate. It is
not a fort, however. In it are kept the
gongs and other musical instruments
by means of which are announced the
rising and the setting of the sun. This
is the gate which was blown up by the
Japanese in their recent attack on and
entry into the city. It is the largest
and most important gate in Peking.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>One</span> of the friendliest cities to the
foreigner. The cry of “Foreign devil!”
is never heard within its walls. The
people have had time to learn how
much they profit by the trade the
foreigner brings, and by the efforts
of the missionaries to ameliorate the
condition of the very poor by their
hospitals. Hangchow is a great centre
of the silk trade. The whole city, which
has a population of 700,000, and the
principal street of which is five miles
long, is surrounded by a wall faced with
hewn stone, such as is shown in the
photograph. It is pierced by many
gates. It is a treaty port, two days’
journey from the great foreign settlement
of Shanghai.</p>

</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>In</span> contrast to Hangchow, though only two miles from a
treaty port, it is believed that no foreigner has ever had
the foolhardiness to enter this gate. It is a city of the
fifth order only; but such is the hatred and detestation
in which the foreigner is held, it would be almost certain
death to him to enter it. This hatred of the foreigner is
a very curious characteristic of the country. No one can
tell how it has arisen, for though one can understand that
the attempts of Western nations to force open the ports of
the country, and the seizure of territory by certain of them,
and perhaps the advent of the missionaries, are causes
enough to provoke opposition and hatred, they do not
account for its ferocity. The idea of the Chinaman and
the Chinawoman is that the foreigner is a child-eater, that
no children are safe within his reach, that he kills children
that he may take their eyes and hearts to make into his
medicines. This belief is so deeply rooted, that when the
cry of “Foreigner!” is raised, in almost any city, the
women will run into the streets, snatch up their children,
and carry them for safety into their homes; and the cry
raised is always “Foreign devil!” “Child-eater!” It may
be noted that a similar suspicion exists over a great part
of Central and Southern Europe towards the Jews, who
are charged with murdering children to mingle their blood
with sacrifices.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Hangchow</span> is the city of silk, a
wealthy and generally well-to-do city.
Everything speaks to the visitor of
silk. The country is covered by the
mulberry tree, which grows in every
available spot. There are thousands of
hand-looms. In the picture given, the
silk is being wound into a thread from
the cocoons, which are thrown into a
pan of hot water, kept hot by a small
furnace; the ends of the threads are
disentangled from the cocoon, four or
five of them taken together are given
a twist by the right hand, whilst the
left winds the thread on to the wheel.
This is the first step in, and the foundation
of, all silk manufacture.</p>

is always a flower-garden. Comparing
this simple house with a palace such as
the English Legation, it will be seen
that the latter is but an amplification

consists of a group or groups of families
with their head men, and over the head
men are the district magistrates. The
family is the centre of everything. The
members are bound together by the
strongest ties, and the family is responsible
for the individual. The people
have quite a genius for self-government,
and every village is self-governing,
having its privileges, which no one dare

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>A very</span> important personage in China. He deals, however,
with men’s shoes only. The women wear tiny satin or
brocaded things which they mostly make and mend themselves.
They are from two to three inches long, and with
hard-working women in the fields the feet never extend
four inches. The Chinese practice of binding the feet of
girls is very old. It is, of course, only a fashion, but it
has the sanction of great antiquity. A girl with her feet
the normal shape would stand no chance of getting married.
The binding process begins very early—between four and
five generally, though sometimes it is postponed to a later
date, when the process is much more painful. The four
toes are doubled under the foot, and the large toe folded
on the top. When bound together a sort of club-foot or
hoof results, but the women manage to walk in spite of
their deformity. To a western eye, the movement resembles
a waddle rather than a walk.</p>

not weaned until they are from three to
five years of age. Chinese women are
very modest and kind-hearted, are faithful
wives, and, according to their own

eighteen shillings English for brass
cash, the weight of them amounted to
seventy-two pounds, which had to be
carried by the coolies. These cash have
a square hole in the middle, and are
strung together upon a piece of straw
twist. Should the straw break, the loss
of time in getting up the pieces is much
more than the loss of the money. The
Chinese are honest, very keen at a
bargain, but when the bargain is made
the Chinaman may be depended on to
keep it.</p>

</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>The</span> great system of irrigation at Sze Chuan was intended
for the cultivation of rice only; but the great and terrible
growth in the demand for opium has caused the cultivation
of the poppy so to increase that it is encroaching on the
rice lands.</p>

<p class='c000'>This may be regarded as the saddest and most terrible
fact as regards the future of China.</p>

<p class='c000'>The use of opium is of comparatively recent date, but
the growth and spreading of the habit has been most rapid.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the first, both local and government officials did
their best to stop it and to stamp out the culture of the
poppy; but although laws were passed making death the
penalty for its cultivation they became a dead letter, until
to-day it is estimated that eighty per cent. of the men and
fifty per cent. of the women, in one or two populous
provinces, are opium smokers. They do not all smoke to
excess. There are moderate smokers as we have our
moderate drinkers; but all through the province of Sze
Chuan the opium shops are as thick as the gin shops in
the lower parts of London.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is not necessary to dilate on the effects of opium
when freely indulged in. They are too well known. China’s
only hope is to emancipate herself from the vice that is
eating away her manhood. But will she be able to do it?</p>
